##Note
This experimental-ardrone branch is, as the name suggest, experimental and
currently being worked on. The code on this branch is safe to use for
flying and testing but as with any flying robot precautions must be taken
into account to ensure saftey of both users and robot.

>General precautions for using this branch include:

> * Plenty of take off room
> * Stable environment (No wind/fans)
> * Keep in mind the range of wifi can be as low as a few meters
> * Bluetooth has a range of approximately 1 meter
