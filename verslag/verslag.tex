\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Our Goal}
Our absolute goal, is winning in some subtasks of the Summer-IMAV 2011 Indoor competition \footnote{\href{http://www.imav2011.org/images/stories/documents/summerimav2011\%20indoor\%20challenges\%20v2.0.pdf}{This link} refers to a pdf file explaining the competition.}.
This is a competition for flying radio controlled vehicles to autonomously solve some tasks. For this competition, we tried to solve the following sub-tasks:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Pick-up Object
    \item Exit Building
    \item Release Object
\end{itemize}
We used the Parrot \Ardrone to solve these problems.

\subsection{The \Ardrone}

The \Ardrone is an over WiFi remote controlled quadrocopter that has several onboard sensors:
\begin{itemize}
	\item One vertical camera, pointing downward \\ This is also used for stabilisation and calculating the speed. It has a 63$^{\circ}$ angle.
	\item One horizontal camera, pointing forward \\ This is a 91$^{\circ}$ angle camera.
	\item Ultrasound altimeter, to measure the altitude
    \item 3 axis accelerometer (measures propellor acceleration)
    \item 2 axis gyrometer 
    \item 1 yaw precision gyrometer
\end{itemize}
Furthermore, it has an onboard computer system running Linux.

\section{Results}
We have not reached all of our goals. There were many problems that we encountered along the road that we were able to solve. We decreased the random flying errors
of the \Ardrone by putting random stuff on the ground (even though it still flies in walls at times) and we were able to work with the complex SDK and workaround
malfunctioning OpenCV functions. But in the end the the flying errors of the \Ardrone proofed fatal. The program we coded is able to successfully pick up the object,
but not always, and then crashes into the nearest obstacle, hard. \\

So we did accomplish a the first sub-task, which was the hardest one. Furthermore we created a bridge between the SDK and Python, allowing any newcomer to simply use 
that (albeit slower, much easier) from the start. Another valuable resource we coded is the option to replay any run, complete with navigation data. One can not understate
how valuable that has been throughout the project. \\

\section{Future Work}
Our project has officially finished. But there are fixes, some minor and other requiring a lot of work that could finish our other sub-tasks, easily. 
\begin{itemize}
    \item A different pick-up method, magnets or velcro. When the \Ardrone picks up the object the object start swinging under the \Ardrone. This causes a lot of
navigational troubles. Landing on the object, and picking it up using velcro might remove navigation troubles caused by a swinging object under the \Ardrone but it 
also will take away the whole bottom camera, which the \Ardrone uses to stabilize itself.
    \item A smaller object with less weight. Easier to pick up and to fly with. 
    \item Something to keep the object from being blown away by the wind the propellors of the \Ardrone create. If we make the object smaller and lighter this will 
become a problem.
    \item Constant altitude when flying over objects. The altitude is measured to whatever is under the \Ardrone. If we tell the \Ardrone to fly at a height of 2 metres
and it flies over some table, the \Ardrone will see that it's flying over a table (or rather something higher than the ground), and increase gaz to fly 2 metres above
the table. This shouldn't be that hard to fix. 
    \item Small adjustments to the code to exit the building. We already have the complete code to recognize bright colors. We could easily put some markers on the
exit of the building and have the \Ardrone fly through those markers. This would complete our second sub-task.
\end{itemize}
