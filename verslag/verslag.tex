\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Our Goal}
Our absolute goal, is winning in some subtasks of the Summer-IMAV 2011 Indoor competition \footnote{\href{http://www.imav2011.org/images/stories/documents/summerimav2011\%20indoor\%20challenges\%20v2.0.pdf}{This link} refers to a pdf file explaining the competition.}.
This is a competition for flying radio controlled vehicles to autonomously solve some tasks. For this competition, we tried to solve the following sub-tasks:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Pick-up Object
    \item Exit Building
    \item Release Object
\end{itemize}
We used the Parrot \Ardrone to solve these problems.

\subsection{The \Ardrone}

The \Ardrone is an over WiFi remote controlled quadrocopter that has several onboard sensors:
\begin{itemize}
	\item One vertical camera, pointing downward \\ This is also used for stabilisation and calculating the speed. It has a 63$^{\circ}$ angle.
	\item One horizontal camera, pointing forward \\ This is a 91$^{\circ}$ angle camera.
	\item Ultrasound altimeter, to measure the altitude
    \item 3 axis accelerometer (measures propellor acceleration)
    \item 2 axis gyrometer 
    \item 1 yaw precision gyrometer
\end{itemize}
Furthermore, it has an onboard computer system running Linux.

% In the presentation we had sections for problems and solutions, but I guess 
% we should just put that stuff in the other chapters (and as Arnoud said
% make it more like "we tried this and this but discarded that because that 
% and that)
